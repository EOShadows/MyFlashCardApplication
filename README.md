# My Flash Card Application: Quizzipoo

Ignore the name, I was just coming up with something real quick.

This application is something I made using the Unity Game Engine, for the purpose of helping me study for exams.
It is a simple flash card application that takes a formatted text file and displays, in random order, a bunch of flash cards.  The user can click on the flashcard to flip it around and display the answer, then they
can tell the program whether they got the answer correct or not.  This will affect certain stats shown on the corner of the screen.

The stats shown on the corner of the screen are:

* Number of cards remaining out of the total
* Number of cards answered correctly so far
* Number of cards answered wrong so far
